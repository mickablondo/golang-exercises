# Golang Exercises
## What's that ?
Exercises to learn to develop applications with Go.  
Let [MiK@](https://github.com/mickablondo) be your guide ...  
## What are these exercises ?
Simples exercices for the moment.   
Open all the go files and try them.  
Edit variables and code to check how the code behaves.  
## How to run the apps ?
First, install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) !  
Then, execute this command : 
```bash
go run .\src\<LEVEL>\<NUM_NAME>\main.go
```
### Hmmm ... why so many folders ?
It's not permitted to declare multiple 'main' functions on the same package.  
To try our code, we need one 'main' by example ... so we need one package by example and a directory is a package for Go !  
Is that clear ? :-)
