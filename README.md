# Golang Exercises
## What's this?
Exercises to learn how to develop applications with Go.  
Let [MiK@](https://github.com/mickablondo) be your guide...  
## What are these exercises?
Simple exercises for now.  
Open all the Go files and try them.  
Edit variables and code to see how the code behaves.  
## How to run the apps?
First, install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)!  
Then, execute this command: 
```bash
go run .\src\<LEVEL>\<NUM_NAME>\main.go
```
### Hmmm... why so many folders?
It's not permitted to declare multiple 'main' functions in the same package.  
To try our code, we need one 'main' function per example... so we need one package per example, and a directory is a package in Go!  
Is that clear? :-)
